Bugs:
    - Changing the number of players in a game causes some kind of infinate loop of duplicate rooms
    - Spectator mode sends the player to the admin page
        - Suspect that dupe check is getting multiple nulls and redirecting everyone to a new seat (not sure why it sends them to admin)
    - Shuffle still isn't working (Everyone is getting suffled twice!)

    - add non count down timer
    - add player number render that doesnt require refreshing the page
